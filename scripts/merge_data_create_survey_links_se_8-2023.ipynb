The old mansion, parts of which date back to the late 17th century, preserves a sense of old New York. The photographs displayed inside the house document a vast range of experiences in Victorian New York. Alice produced over 7,000 photographs of a rapidly changing New York City, making significant contributions to photographic history, documenting New York immigrant populations, Victorian wome social activities, and the natural and architectural world of her travels.The picturesque grounds look over Buono Beach, a peaceful strip of land bordering the New York Bay. Together, the mansion and waterfront make a lovely detour from the busy 21st century. There is a kayak and canoe launch\" \n",
