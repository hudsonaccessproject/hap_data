### EJ analysis

# Calculate acres within ej zones
# Number of sites with programs in ej vs. non
# Calculate distance to sites within and outside ej zones
# some other questions to explore: 
#   - how is distribution of sites within EJ zones in NJ compared to NY?
#   - in addition to distance to sites, how accessible by public transit (train + ferry) 
#   - we can also break it down by activity type
#   - highlight EJ areas with lowest density of sites


## acquire population, decennial census for NY & NJ
## select only those in HAP extent
## send to Sara
##### figure out which EJ definition we'll use
### look at this: NY NJ HEP DAC definitions and map - https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1mt0aj9oRZDHasAZO3PIYVMDpd4uwu_g&ll=41.24926135001247%2C-73.86722766214014&z=8
##### disadvantaged or overburdened census tracts figure out which one I think we shoudl use and run it by sara and then use

# Calculate average distance to sites within and outside ej zones
# Number of sites with programs in ej vs. non
# census blocks within 1/2 mile of water (ej or not)
# along shoreline, Calculate acres within ej zones
