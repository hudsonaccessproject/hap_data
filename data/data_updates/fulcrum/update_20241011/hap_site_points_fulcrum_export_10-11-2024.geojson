Today, it is one of New York City's most unique parks, offering visitors an opportunity to get up close and personal with a resilient waterfront design and innovative architectural features. Towards the south of the park, follow a zig-zagging pathway through the newly restored marshlands - or stand on top of a cantilevered platform to see it from above. Towards the middle of the park, follow a sweeping pathway towards the waterfront, where you will find a permanent art installation, titled “Luminescence” designed by local artist Nobuho Nagasawa.\n\nTo access the boat launch, walk down 56th Avenue and cross 2nd street. The launch offers a gently sloping ramp straight down to the water and benches to rest. Launch a kayak or canoe from this launch to explore Newtown Creek.

The Creek has undergone many topographical and name changes throughout its history.\n\nIn the 17th century, the creek did not extend so far eastward, ending instead around what is now Cropsey Avenue. A small portion of land in the now narrow section of the creek connected to the mainland, forming a peninsula. This peninsula was known as Coney Hook. In order to facilitate sea travel, Thomas Stillwell and his associates dug a canal from the eastern front of the creek, around Cropsey Avenue, eastward until they hit “the Cove,” now known as Sheepshead Bay. The developers hoped the canal, referred to as Gravesend Ship Canal, would transform the area into a thriving seaport.
