In the 1600s, the Red Hook district was settled by the Dutch. As the land became more developed and the population grew, the shipping industry began to take form. With the growth of the New York Harbor and accompanying changes on the waterfront, Red Hook became one of the nation's premier shipping centers in the 19th century. This pier is a reminder of the shipping industry that once occupied the waters of the Buttermilk Channel and the Upper New York Harbor. This is a great spot for fishing and launching a canoe or kayak.",Dawn to Dusk,April 1 to December 1,N,Y,B61 bus service,,NYC Parks,,,Beach access is restricted through concrete path.,"Watch for fishing lines, swift currents off the end of the pier, commercial traffic and a 100-yard security zone around the cruise ship terminal",,Y,Red Hook Boaters,"Participants in our programs utilize club kayaks for a short paddle inside the protected area of Louis Valentino Jr. Pier Park. After being fitted with PFD, a Red Hook Boater will give safety and paddling tips and will help with boarding and supervise departure.  Paddlers are free to explore the protected cove at their own pace and enjoy harbor views and wildlife of the estuary, but rides are limited to 15-20 minutes at a time to give everyone a chance. Before or after your trip, we ask that you join us in our beach cleanup, removing trash that has washed ashore. We supply the gloves and trash bags.  In addition, on a few selected dates throughout the season, paddlers who have volunteered time with the Red Hook Boaters may join us for open water tours to Brooklyn Bridge Park, Governors Island, the Gowanus Canal or the shorelines of Red Hook and Buttermilk Channel.",https://www.redhookboaters.org/calendar,,Porta potty restrooms only.,Y,Y,N,N,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,,,,N,Y,Y,,,louisjrvalentinopier_01.jpg,louisjrvalentinopier_02.jpg,louisjrvalentinopier_03.jpg,Alyssa Bement,NYC Parks,city_park,https://www.riverkeeper.org/water-quality/citizen-data/new-york-city-waterfront/red-hook-valentino-pier-beach/,"Pier, beach",40.67845235,-74.01777062,1,

We also offer a number of Open Paddles where we open the boathouse to the community to simply come out and enjoy Jamaica Bay on your own. Open Paddles are perfect for new paddlers as a way to learn the basic skills of paddling at your own pace. Our Open Paddles are also open to more experienced paddlers who want to enjoy Jamaica Bay in a non-scheduled setting. Guided Group Paddles are geared more towards experienced paddlers who can be out on the water for an hour or more at a time.,http://communityboathouse.org/,Gateway Bike & Boathouse,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NYC Parks,,,,40.59035813,-73.81436913,1,
