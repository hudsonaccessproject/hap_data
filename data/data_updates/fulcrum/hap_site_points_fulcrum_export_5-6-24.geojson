When you cross the pedestrian bridge at East 177th Street, you will enter a vital link along the Bronx River Greenway. This 13-acre park now features a synthetic turf multi-purpose field, picnic area, two new playgrounds with spray showers, basketball courts, multi-use pathways, and floating docks. More than three-quarters of a mile of new greenway will connect Starlight Park with Bronx Park to the north and Concrete Plant Park, Hunts Point Riverside Park, and Barretto Point Park to the south.","hours_info":null,"open_close_date":null,"fee":null,"public_transit":"Y","public_transit_description":"Subway: 2, 5, 6","url_public":"www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/kayak/63","site_manager":null,"phone_site_manager":null,"email_site_manager":"dshuffler@ympj.org","accessibility_description":null,"safety":null,"use_limits":null,"program_yn":"Y","program_name":"Bronx River Alliance","program_description":null,"program_url":null,"program_contact":"Bronx River Alliance","amenities_description":null,"bike_path_accessible":null,"restrooms":"Y","changing_station":null,"food":null,"drinking_water":null,"walking_trails":null,"equipment_rental":null,"boat_launch_yn":null,"parking":"Y","parking_descripton":null,"wheelchair_access_restrooms":null,"wheelchair_access_trails":null,"swim_yn":null,"fish_yn":null,"hpbl_yn":null,"mpbl_yn":null,"boat_cleaning_requirements":null,"site_name_photo_01":null,"site_name_photo_02":null,"site_name_photo_03":null,"photo_credits":null,"owner":"NYC Parks","owner_type":null,"water_quality_monitoring":null,"typology":null,"lat":"40.83319196","long":"-73.88236317","near_cso":"1","cso_label":null,"sq_acres":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88236317,40.83319196]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"fulcrum_id":"b5fa1913-f4c9-4a20-867d-84ff63d521e8","created_at":"2024-04-18 13:37:45 EDT","updated_at":"2024-04-18 13:37:45 EDT","created_by":"eichnersara@gmail.com","updated_by":"eichnersara@gmail.com","system_created_at":"2024-04-18 13:37:45 EDT","system_updated_at":"2024-04-18 13:37:45 EDT","version":1,"status":null,"project":null,"assigned_to":null,"latitude":40.5923775,"longitude":-73.89000327,"site_id":"152","act_codes":"MPBL,HPBL,FISH","act_codes_other":null,"access_id":"180, 181, 337, 371, 161, 000, 000, 000","site_name":"Floyd Bennett Field at Jamaica Bay","site_label":null,"site_address_sub_thoroughfare":null,"site_address_thoroughfare":"127-267 Aviation Rd, Brooklyn, NY 11234","site_address_suite":null,"site_address_locality":null,"site_address_sub_admin_area":null,"site_address_admin_area":null,"site_address_postal_code":null,"site_address_country":null,"site_address_full":"127-267 Aviation Rd, Brooklyn, NY 11234","site_description":"A 1933 seaplane ramp provides access to southwestern Jamaica Bay.
